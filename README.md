# Classifier for Rabies infected Neurons
The model classifies three different possible classes-Neuron, background and partial Neuron-for a larger agenda of detecting/annotating rabies infected neurons from brain scans of mice. The brain scans are of the size 10000 times 10000 (pixel unit). As general cell detection algorithms (Ex. Unet) do not perform well on this case due to signal to noise ratio. The rabies neurons on average have a diameter of 25-30 pixel size compared to even a moderate cropped image size of 512 times 512 yields a very low signal to noise ratio. 

Hence, we use a classification algorithm as above that classifies cropped images of size 50 times 50 into three different possible classes-a single neuron, just background tissue and many neurons or partial neurons. Using this classifier we should achieve annotation (coordinates of rabies-neurons in the bigger image) of rabies-neurons in the bigger image. The above model can classify with almost 99% validation and test accuracy for our data.
